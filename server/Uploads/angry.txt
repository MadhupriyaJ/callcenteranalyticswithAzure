Person A: "I can't believe you did that! You knew how important this project was to me!"

Person B: "Are you seriously blaming me for this? I've been doing everything I can, and you’re the one who didn’t give clear instructions!"

Person A: "Clear instructions? I spelled everything out for you! You just didn't bother to listen!"

Person B: "Oh, so now it's my fault for not reading your mind? Maybe if you weren't so vague about what you wanted, this wouldn’t have happened!"

Person A: "Vague? I was very specific! You're just making excuses because you messed up!"

Person B: "I messed up? You didn’t even check in on the progress, and now you're dumping all the blame on me? That’s not fair!"

Person A: "Because I trusted you to handle it! Obviously, that was a mistake!"

Person B: "You know what? I’m done with this. If you’re going to keep pointing fingers instead of solving the problem, then figure it out yourself!"

Person A: "Fine! I will! Maybe it’s better this way!"
